# File-MetaData-API

This project is part of my FreeCodeCamp Back End Development and API certification. It's a simple API for analyzing file metadata, built with Node.js and Express. Users can upload a file, and the API responds with details like the file name, type, and size. 

**Usage:**
1. Visit the live app: https://api-file-metadata-.glitch.me/
2. Upload a file to see its metadata.
